        <p>
          Run-length encoding (RLE) is a very simple form of lossless data compression in which runs of data (that is, sequences in which the same data value occurs in many consecutive data elements) are stored as a single data value and count, rather than as the original run. This is most useful on data that contains many such runs. Consider, for example, simple graphic images such as icons, line drawings, and animations. It is not useful with files that don't have many runs as it could greatly increase the file size.
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, consider a screen containing plain black text on a solid white background. There will be many long runs of white pixels in the blank space, and many short runs of black pixels within the text. A hypothetical scan line, with B representing a black pixel and W representing white, might read as follows:<br>

WWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWBBBWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWBWWWWWWWWWWWWWW<br>
With a run-length encoding (RLE) data compression algorithm applied to the above hypothetical scan line, it can be rendered as follows:<br>

12W1B12W3B24W1B14W<br>
This can be interpreted as a sequence of twelve Ws, one B, twelve Ws, three Bs, etc.<br><br>

        <p><h5>History and Applications</h5>
          Run-length encoding schemes were employed in the transmission of television signals as far back as 1967.[1] It is particularly well suited to palette-based bitmapped images such as computer icons, and was a popular image compression method on early online services such as CompuServe before the advent of more sophisticated formats such as GIF.[2] It does not work well at all on continuous-tone images such as photographs, although JPEG uses it quite effectively on the coefficients that remain after transforming and quantizing image blocks.<br>

Common formats for run-length encoded data include Truevision TGA, PackBits, PCX and ILBM. The ITU also describes a standard to encode run-length-colour for fax machines, known as T.45.[3] The standard, which is combined with other techniques into Modified Huffman coding,[citation needed] is relatively efficient because most faxed documents are generally white space, with occasional interruptions of black.<br>
